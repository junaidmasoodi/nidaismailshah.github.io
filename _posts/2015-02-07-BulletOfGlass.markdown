Without an owner, to lend all your beliefs to,

For life wouldn't be a life anymore,

And with a blasphemic purpose of life,

I propose the downfall of all my creation

A glimpse of the orator's script,

And i wouldn't have to die for a heaven anymore

Am i too selfish?

Or too cruel to nature's beliefs?

For i don't want to breathe anymore,

And i didn't know it would be a loss,

The loss of a poem for that matter,

A trigger, a barrel, and the bullet of glass,

From the beloved , to the beloved,

Find me a singer, and let her smile,

So i could cry in remorse again,

Find me a poet and all his poetry,

So i could be able to die again.
