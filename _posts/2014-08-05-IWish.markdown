Here in this valley of flawed emotions

and fake existences

They know me, they all seem familiar to me

And that is a shame.

A loss, so irreparable.


These distant lights

i have always wanted to dissolve into, and

When the past has never been so bright before

The horizon is here.


The horizon is here, all black in color

I wish i could be as far as the horizon,from myself.

The waters, black sky, bloody clouds


I wish i had known how to swim

I wish i had known how to swim

And then not swim and drown, all alone.


And on this night of despair

I wish i could be the star that doesn't twinkle

I wish i could be the star that isn't shining tonight

I wish i could be the star that chose not to rise,

I wish i could be the star that doesn't exist.

I wish.
