	<p>I am trying hard not to associate myself with a particular technology or a language. I like declarative style of programming which allows me to focus on 'what to do' rather than 'how to do it'. Consequently, I believe in giving the 'problem' more attention than the 'method' i choose to solve it. I know it's already too late, but i like to treat myself as a beginner.</p>
